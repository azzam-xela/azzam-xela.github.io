# My Personal Website
Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme.

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and blog. Itâ€™s based on the Chirpy Starter theme but includes custom configuration, content, and styling specific to my use.
