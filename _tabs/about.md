Howdy! I’m Alex—an aspiring information security professional with a keen interest in CTFs, malware analysis, and malware development. I’m currently a mathematics major at the University of Western Australia, but since discovering the exciting world of cybersecurity, I’ve dedicated countless hours to exploring its intricacies.

From reverse-engineering malware and writing (or attempting to write!) assembly exploits, to pulling apart IoT devices and building home labs to practice purple teaming, I’m always on the hunt for new challenges and learning opportunities.

Away from the screens, you’ll often find me soaking up the sun on my motorbike or hitting up the climbing gym.
