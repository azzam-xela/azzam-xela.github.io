Howdy, I’m **Alex**!

I’m currently a second-year mathematics student at the University of Western Australia, where I try to balance pure mathematics with the applied.

Despite this, I’ve found myself far more drawn to the world of information security and its endless stream of problems to solve. 
Most of my focus so far has been on developing skills in penetration testing, primarily through Hack The Box labs and their academy. Alongside this, I’ve been steadily building skills in hardware and IoT vulnerability research.


When I’m not lit by a wall of screens or doing my best to not get burnt whilst soldering, you’ll probably find me on my motorbike soaking up the sea breeze, or at the climbing gym.


### Current priorities: 
- **Hack the Box - [Penetration Tester Pathway](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester)**
  - Deep dive into core security assessment concepts and specialized tools, tactics, and methodologies used in penetration testing.
- **InvokeRE - [Introduction to Malware Binary Triage](https://training.invokere.com/about)**
  - Hands-on reverse engineering and analysis of real-world malware samples—from nation-state SMB worms to prolific ransomware.
- **Constructing Defense -  [Purple Teaming Home Lab](https://course.constructingdefense.com/constructing-defense)**
  - Building a local and multi-cloud lab environment featuring various Windows AD setups, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, and more.
- **From Day Zero to Zero Day - [Vulnerability Research](https://fromdayzerotozeroday.com/)**
  - target selection, taint analysis, code mapping, automated variant discovery, reverse engineering, fuzzing, and coordinated disclosure.
