Howdy — I’m **Alex**.

I’m a second-year mathematics student at the University of Western Australia, working toward a career in information security with a focus on penetration testing and hardware-focused vulnerability research.

Most of my time is spent on Hack The Box, uploading JSON files to BloodHound for what feels like the hundredth time… or tearing down IoT devices just to see what makes them tick.

When I’m not lit by a wall of screens or soldering components back into place, you’ll probably find me on my motorbike or at the climbing gym.


### Current priorities: 
- **Hack the Box - [Penetration Tester Pathway](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester)**
  - Deep dive into core security assessment concepts and specialized tools, tactics, and methodologies used in penetration testing.
- **InvokeRE - [Introduction to Malware Binary Triage](https://training.invokere.com/about)**
  - Hands-on reverse engineering and analysis of real-world malware samples—from nation-state SMB worms to prolific ransomware.
- **Maldev Academy - [Malware Development Course](https://maldevacademy.com)**
    - Exploring Windows internals, malware development, C programming, Windows API usage, reverse engineering, and evading host-based security solutions.
- **Constructing Defense -  [Purple Teaming Home Lab](https://course.constructingdefense.com/constructing-defense)**
  - Building a local and multi-cloud lab environment featuring various Windows AD setups, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, and more.
