Howdy, I’m **Alex**!

I’m currently a second-year mathematics student at the University of Western Australia.

Despite initially falling in love with mathematics, I felt the real-world impact was missing. One day I stumbled upon HackTheBox and that set in motion what as been an incredibly exciting journey into the world of infosec.

Most of my focus so far has been on developing skills in penetration testing (as evidienced by my blog posts) primarily through HackTheBox labs and their academy. 


Recently, I've stumbled into the world of hardware 'hacking' and the weird-and-wacky world of IoT devices, where i'm developing skills in not burning myself (soldering UART pins) and deciphering the dark-texts (disassembling firmware in Ghidra).


When I’m not lit by a wall of screens, you’ll probably find me on out on my motorbike soaking up the sea breeze, or flailing at the climbing gym.


### Current priorities: 
- **Hack the Box - [Penetration Tester Pathway](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester)**
  - Deep dive into core security assessment concepts and specialized tools, tactics, and methodologies used in penetration testing.
- **InvokeRE - [Introduction to Malware Binary Triage](https://training.invokere.com/about)**
  - Hands-on reverse engineering and analysis of real-world malware samples - from nation-state SMB worms to prolific ransomware.
- **Constructing Defense -  [Purple Teaming Home Lab](https://course.constructingdefense.com/constructing-defense)**
  - Building a local and multi-cloud lab environment featuring various Windows AD setups, Kubernetes, Azure, AWS, and more.
- **From Day Zero to Zero Day - [Vulnerability Research](https://fromdayzerotozeroday.com/)**
  - Target selection, taint analysis, code mapping, automated variant discovery, reverse engineering, fuzzing, and coordinated disclosure.
