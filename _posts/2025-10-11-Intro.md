Howdy!

Thank you for visiting my blog. 
Over the next few months i'll be redoing a lot of my existing write-ups. Mostly this will consist of boxes from Hack The Box. 
As part of my efforts towards hardware-focused vulnerability research, I’ll also be publishing IoT device tear-downs.
One of the first in the backlog is a write-up on the TP-Link TL-WR841N router.


To deepen my understanding of certain topics, I plan to post more long-form, exploratory content as well. Since I’m currently focused on completing the [CPTS](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist) exam, most of these posts will revolve around specific techniques or attack paths I find particularly interesting during that journey.

The general vibe i'm aiming for is:
- 1 write-up per week
- 1 deep dive or IoT device tear-down per month

Until next time,
Alex
